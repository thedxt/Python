# BD Script Maker

Imports a CSV file and uses the contents of the CSV to output PowerShell scripts. 

This was purpose built for use with BitDefender Gravity Zone MSI deployments but can be adapted for other uses.

See example CSV for what the CSV file should look like and see the example PowerShell script to see what the end result is.
